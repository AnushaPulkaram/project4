    <center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>
        <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>
    In the previous chapters, decisions models have been modeled based on the<br>
economic point of view of the problem expressed mainly through quantitative<br>
values and, in some cases by qualitative representation. The economic per-<br>spective draws unique coherence from economic assumptions of rational<br>
behavior and it draws predictive power from strongly valid rules of influence<br>
that employ mathematical or logical operators. Because the decision must be<br>
expressed in a way that is compatible with the rules of inference, great<br>
simplicity, and structure are required. In strategic decision making problems<br>
great effort has been directed toward relaxing the mathematical constraints,<br>
while retaining the economic — logic inference.
    </div><br>
    
    <div>
    Another important aspect to be considered is that in both theoretical and<br>
practical decision-making models, fixed numbers of decision alternatives or<br>
prefixed value of parameters have been considered. The major inputs to the<br>
analysis of an econometric model of decision-making process are subjective<br>
    </div><br><br><br>
    <hr><br><br><br>
    <div>probabilities, utility values, and decision tree structures. Individuals may differ<br>
in their subjective value of probabilities, their utilities of outcomes or in their<br>
perceptions of the subsequent actions available. Strategic decision problems<br>
involve not only one person’s opinion but involve a group of individuals<br>
belonging to different classes and levels of interests inside and outside the<br>
organization. No longer is the problem concerned with the selection of the<br>
preferred alternative of one person. The analysis must be extended for a group<br>
of decision-makers, each one exhibiting a certain preference structure, per-<br>ceiving different consequences, and corresponding to a diverse set of interest<br>
and responsibility. In some cases, depending on the number of persons<br>
involved as well as on the nature of the decision problem (for instance,<br>
promoting or hiring persons or, electing the president) it will be necessary to<br>
adopt a voting system.</div><br>
    <div>
    How can different groups of individual affect a decision-making process? In<br>
this chapter, we consider some behavioral aspects of individuals and group of<br>
individuals that may affect a decision-making process.
    </div><br>
    <div>
    Behavioral perspectives of competitive decision-making are neither as well<br>
articulated nor as complete as those of economic view. In behavioral views<br>
cognitive limitations and the use of mental effort are emphasized. In contrast to<br>
the rational approach of the economic frame, the behavioral views acknowl-<br>edge that players may adopt different kind of rationality.

    <center><h2>Individual and Group<br>
Behavioral Models</h2></center>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>Behavioral theory, adopted by the social sciences, reminds us that competition<br>
which occurs in practice does not take into account just systematic and logical<br>
decisions about wins and losses. The behavioral perspective examines which<br>
attitude an administrator or a business assumes when faced with a given<br>
situation. It is a way of explaining how the decision alternatives were selected<br>
to formulate the strategy. It also works to minimize the influence of the<br>
subjective determination of the qualitative and quantitative values of the<br>
parameters involved.</div><br>
    <div>In general, strategic decision-making is a procedure for making decisions<br>
working against some competitor or against the state of nature. The states of</div><br><br><br>
    <hr><br><br><br>
    <div>nature or the scenarios that can occur involve risk or uncertainties with regard<br>
to market behavior, climatic influences, available capital, etc. A company<br>
should have knowledge about the possible scenarios and the risks built into<br>
these scenarios and choose a decision alternative.</div><br>
    <div><em>A competitive situation, or one of conflict,</em> occurs when the result of a<br>
decision is influenced by decisions made by other participants. Game theory,<br>
formulated by Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), analyzes decisions<br>
made where conflict exists. Game theory examines actions and reactions to the<br>
existing alternatives in order to analyze and plan a competitive strategy. It<br>
allows the administrator to analyze the systematic mode of wins and losses<br>
resulting from a given action, as well as the possible wins and losses of the<br>
competitor.</div><br>
    <div>Administrators’ behavior often does not rigorously obey the principles of game<br>
theory. This stance could bring about beneficial results in some cases. Experi-<br>mental studies reporting on situations, where a player, with no knowledge of<br>
game theory or behavioral theory, plays against an adversary, are related by<br>
Day and others (1997). To illustrate the complexity of the behavioral perspec-<br>tive we show an extension of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, called the Social<br>
Dilemma game by Raiffa (2002).</div><br><br>
    <h3>The Prisoner’s Dilemma Game</h3>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>In a two persons non-zero sum game between two people, gain f<sub>1</sub>(i,j) = a<sub>ij</sub> of<br>
    player 1 and gain f<sub>2</sub>(i,j) = b<sub>ij</sub> of player 2 are different when player 1 chooses<br>
    strategy i and player 2 chooses strategy j. In this case, the sum of the gains a<sub>ij</sub><br>
+ b<sub>ij</sub> is different from de zero.</div><br>
    <div>The value of the game is defined by the equilibrium point or <em>saddle point</em>, which<br>
is the point (i*, j*) which satisfies the equalities:</div><br>
    <div class="mar">
    f<sub>1</sub>(i*, j*) = Max<sub>i</sub> f<sub>1</sub>(i, j*) and<br>
f<sub>2</sub>(i*, j*) = Max<sub>j</sub> f<sub>2</sub>(i*, j).</div>
    <br><br>
    <div>The point of equilibrium is the point (i*, j*) which provides the greatest gain for<br>
player 1 as well as player 2, and is the most convenient point of gain for both<br>
players. Note that, if one of the players moves away from this point, while the<br>
adversary remains at this point, this player’s gain is diminished. However, this</div><br><br><br>
    <hr><br><br><br>
    <div>does not always occur as we can see in the problem known as the Prisoner’s<br>
Dilemma.</div><br><br>
    
    <div class="heading">
        <em>The Game</em>
    <hr>
    </div><br>
    <div>Two prisoners who are accused of the same crime are kept in separate cells and<br>
are being interrogated separately by the police.</div><br><br>
    <div class="mar">
    If <u><em>both prisoners confess</em></u> to the crime, both will be sentenced to 10<br>
years in prison.<br><br>
If <u><em>neither of the two prisoners confesses,</em></u> the police, using circum-<br>stantial evidence can only sentence them to 2 years.<br><br>
If just <u><em>one of the prisoners confesses,</em></u> this prisoner will receive, as a<br>
reward, a light sentence of one year in prison and the other, who did not<br>
confess, will be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
    </div><br><br>
    <div>Since the years in prison are penalties (and not gains), they are represented by<br>
negative values and we can determine the equilibrium point of the game.</div><br><br>

    <div>This example is a game between two persons with different gains (two person<br>
nonzero sum game). The following observations can be made. The equilibrium<br>
point, which theoretically would be the best decision for both prisoners,<br>
corresponds to the decision (Confess, Confess) with a penalty of (-10,-10)<br>
marked with asterisks (*).</div><br>
    <div>Nevertheless, the best decision (lighter penalties) for both prisoners would be<br>
(not confess, not confess) with penalties (-2,-2), that is, 2 years in prison for<br>
each.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
